# Widget `airtable-import`

You can import data from Airtable into AITable to quickly start using AITable to grow your business.

## Get Personal Access Token

To use the widget, you first need to get a Personal Access Token from your Airtable account. Once you have obtained it, simply enter it into the widget to begin fetching raw data and importing it.

You can use [this link](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) to create and manage your Personal Access Token. Please note that a Personal Access Token is not the same as an API Key used previously. Airtable has announced that they will stop supporting API Keys by the end of January 2024. To learn more details, you can read [this article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-api-key-deprecation-notice).

After accessing the page for creating and managing personal access tokens, simply click on the "Generate new token" button to create a fresh Personal Access Token.
